# VertigoRemasteredLIV
Adds LIV support to Vertigo Remastered, allowing for mixed reality capture or avatars in third person.

Currently there is some graphics/alpha issues with the mod that look difficult to resolve to someone like me who is still relatively inexperienced with Unity modding.

# Installation and use
- Download MelonLoader Installer and install 0.5.7 in Vertigo Remastered folder.
- From the [VertigoRemasteredLIV release zip](https://github.com/Jas2o/VertigoRemasteredLIV/releases), extract the folder Mods into Vertigo Remastered folder.
- Start the game from Steam.
- From the game's spectator window at the top right, suggest selecting Third Person to help with some of the graphics issues (but then you need to use OpenVR capture for a HMD POV).
- From LIV, change Capture tab to Manual and select vertigo.exe (not Melon Loader).
